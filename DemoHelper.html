Once in drawing mode, you can draw on the screen:</p><img alt="DemoHelper Example" height=297 src=./img/demohelper/DemoHelperExample.1349a084.png width=510><p>As shown in the screenshot above, it's possible to draw arrows and lines in different colors. Also a special "Marker" is available to highlight areas on the screen, as done above with the "file2.*" filenames.<p>The colors are merged together with the screen by default. But it's possible to draw with solid colors if needed.<p>If you activate the <em>show mouseclicks</em> and/or the <em>show keystrokes</em>, an overlay text is shown in the bottom left of the active monitor showing the mouse clicks and keystrokes. Only keystrokes are shown that are typed together with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd> and <kbd>Win</kbd>.</p><img alt="DemoHelper Overlay" height=356 src=./img/demohelper/DemoHelperOverlay.c79d3900.png width=374><h3 id=keyboard>Keyboard shortcuts</h3><h4 id=zooming>Zooming Mode</h4><dl><dt>up<dd>zooms in<dt>down<dd>zooms out<dt>enter or left mouse click<dd>activates drawing of the zoomed area<dt>escape<dd>cancels zooming mode</dl>Zooming is also possible using the mouse wheel.<h4 id=zooming>Live Zooming Mode</h4><p>In live zooming mode the screen is magnified live, which means you can interact with the magnified part as usual. The mouse/touch and keyboard work with the magnified windows. However, this also means that keyboard shortcuts are also passed on to the other windows, and DemoHelper can't use the normal keys.
