For tools that are supposed to be started automatically on logon, this ensures that the whole startup time doesn't increase by several seconds.<p>AAClr also detects changes in wallpapers by catching events from the system and doesn't use timers that access the wallpaper file several times a second (like Aura does). That means that AAClr is idle most of the time and only wakes up when necessary.<p>And about resource usage: AAClr uses less than 2MB of private bytes - I think that's not too much.<p>I've put the AAClr source code into the <a href=/StExBar.html>StExBar</a> repository since it's too small to justify creating its own project for it. You can browse the source code <a href=https://sourceforge.net/p/stefanstools/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/Misc/AAClr/ >here</a>.<p>A compiled executable can be found on the <a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/stefanstools/files/AAClr/ >download page</a>.</div></div><footer class=main-sprite><ul><li><a href=https://pages.github.com/ ><img alt="Github Pages" height=15 src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='40'%20height='40'%20viewBox='12%2012%2040%2040'%3E%3Cpath%20fill='%23aaaaaa'%20d='M32,13.4c-10.5,0-19,8.5-19,19c0,8.4,5.5,15.5,13,18c1,0.2,1.3-0.4,1.3-0.9c0-0.5,0-1.7,0-3.2%20c-5.3,1.1-6.4-2.6-6.4-2.6C20,41.6,18.8,41,18.8,41c-1.7-1.2,0.1-1.1,0.1-1.1c1.9,0.1,2.9,2,2.9,2c1.7,2.9,4.5,2.1,5.5,1.6%20c0.2-1.2,0.7-2.1,1.2-2.6c-4.2-0.5-8.7-2.1-8.7-9.4c0-2.1,0.7-3.7,2-5.1c-0.2-0.5-0.8-2.4,0.2-5c0,0,1.6-0.5,5.2,2%20c1.5-0.4,3.1-0.7,4.8-0.7c1.6,0,3.3,0.2,4.7,0.7c3.6-2.4,5.2-2,5.2-2c1,2.6,0.4,4.6,0.2,5c1.2,1.3,2,3,2,5.1c0,7.3-4.5,8.9-8.7,9.4%20c0.7,0.6,1.3,1.7,1.3,3.5c0,2.6,0,4.6,0,5.2c0,0.5,0.4,1.1,1.3,0.9c7.5-2.6,13-9.7,13-18.1C51,21.9,42.5,13.4,32,13.4z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Github Pages" width=15></a><li>• © <a href=./about.html>Stefan Küng</a></ul><p>Site last updated: Monday, July 13th, 2020, 19:19:44 GMT+0200</footer><script async src=./js/pack.0cde16ce.js></script>
